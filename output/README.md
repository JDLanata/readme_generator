## Description

   By using the Inquirer NPM package the user is given a series of prompts for sections that are normally inside a standard README document. The user answeres these prompts with the information that they want to. The program then places the information in the section it was assigned to.

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
