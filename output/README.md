## Description

By using the inquirer NPM package the user is given a series of prompts for sections that are normally inside a standard README document. The user then answers these prompts with the information that they want placed on the page. The program then places the information into the sections it was assigned to.

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
